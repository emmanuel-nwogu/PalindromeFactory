# PalindromeFactory

The aim of PalindromeFactory is to write word palindromes to a text file line by line. This project uses the [MIT JWI Java library](http://projects.csail.mit.edu/jwi/) to access [WordNetÂ®](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/) database files. The words in said database files are then iterated through and checked against this program&#39;s standards for a word palindrome. Words that meet the criteria are the added to the text file.

The palindromes produced by this project are later used in a Palindromes [app](https://github.com/emmanuel-nwogu/Palindromes).
